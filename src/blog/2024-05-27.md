# Release Note
Today we released a major version update, bringing many new features and capabilities.

## Scaffolding
Some issues have been fixed and some new features have been added to the scaffolding.

### New Features
- Support for automatically copying dynamic link libraries that need to be linked, which is very important for our use of capabilities like OpenSSL, and can reduce some understanding and usage costs.

### Issue Fixes
- Fixed the problem that the artifact command sometimes generates wrong multi-level folders. This would increase our package size and fail to get the correct final product.

## SDK
In terms of the SDK, we have synchronized the latest code from the upstream napi-rs and added some new features.

### New Features
- `ThreadsafeFuntion` supports setting call priority
- Support for some extended APIs of N-API on HarmonyOS, please refer to the [issue](https://github.com/ohos-rs/example/issues/15) for supported capabilities
- Removed the `JsExternal` data structure, this change is a breaking change, please use `External` instead
- Added most examples of compact mode


We strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest version to ensure you get the latest capabilities. If there are any problems, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/ohos-rs/ohos-rs/issues).
